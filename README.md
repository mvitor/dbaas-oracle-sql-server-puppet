# dbaas-oracle-sql-server-puppet

These Puppet manifests are an outcome of a personal project made in 2017. I tried to prove the functionality of DBaaS in Puppet by installing and maintaining Oracle and SQL DBs using Puppet and the available Puppet open source modules. I am sharing the Puppet manifest files as they might be interesting to someone.

## Puppet Manifests 
Puppet manifests to set up Oracle and SQL Server databases using Puppet modules.  

### Oracle 
For Oracle there are manifests for Standalone/Standby(DR)/ASM/Grid(HA) setup with Patching and configuration. 

### SQL Server 
For SQL Server only the Standalone Standard Edition has been tested.
